## Moto emergency exercises with voice commands.

### Build logic:

- Emergency maneuvers like high speed braking and swerving cannot be properly excercised, because planning the moves ahead removes the recognition/reaction/action time.
- This thing runs sessions where random action voice commands (break / swerve) are given on random times (via headphones connected to phone).
- Can get more of a practice run-type experience with a short session where pauses are smaller, or a more realistic option with an hour long session where the pauses can be very long (difficult to be on alert the entire time).
- City traffic mode just asks to find hasards and escape routes (good habit to have) as should not do emergency maneuvers in traffic.

### Issue:
- Worked, but needs to be turned into an app as browsers throttle background sounds - making it difficult to use on a phone when riding.
- Should not need to keep the window active on the screen, nor look at the phone while riding.
